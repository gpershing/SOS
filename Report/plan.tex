\section{Project Plan}
SOS language was designed and developed as a project for the class "Programming Languages and Translators - 4115" taught by Prof. Stephen Edwards in Spring 2021 at Columbia University. We host our project in a Github repository to use Git as a version control system, with Project Kanban enabled to manage the project. We also have bi-weekly meetings on Friday to get updates from team members and ask questions.
